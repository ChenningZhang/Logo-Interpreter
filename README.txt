Logo-Interpreter
================
It's time to write a fully functional interpreter! You've written several interpreters up till now, starting with calc.scm, and this project has the same basic eval and apply as the other interpreters.

In Chapter 4 we study a Scheme interpreter written in Scheme, the metacircular evaluator. In this project we modify that evaluator to turn it into an interpreter for a different programming language.

This project is valuable for several reasons: First, it will make you more familiar with the structure of the metacircular evaluator because you'll have to understand which procedure to modify in order to change some aspect of its operation. Second, working with another language may help overcome some of the confusion students often have about talking to two different versions of Scheme at once. In this project, it'll be quite obvious when you're talking to Scheme and when you're talking to Logo. Third, this project will encourage you to think about the design of a programming language. Why did Scheme's designers and Logo's designers make different choices?

This is a two-week project. As in the adventure game project, you'll have a group of two people, person A and person B. Each week you will do some of the work separately and then meet together for the final steps. After the first week you should be able to enter instructions using primitive procedures with constant arguments. In the second week you will add variables and user-defined procedures. Just like in project 3, one person will submit the entire project when you've finished.
